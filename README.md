Drivine is a graph database client for Node.js and TypeScript. It was created with the following design goals: 

* Support multiple graph databases (simultaneously, if you wish). Currently [AgensGraph](https://bitnine.net/agensgraph/) and 
[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/neo4j-graph-database/). 
* **Scale to hundreds and thousands of transactions per second, without compromising architectural integrity.**
